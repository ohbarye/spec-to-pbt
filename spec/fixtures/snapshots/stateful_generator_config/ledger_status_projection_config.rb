# Regeneration-safe customization file for ledger_status_projection stateful scaffold.
# Edit this file to map spec command names to your real Ruby API and observed-state checks.
# This file is user-owned and should not be overwritten automatically.
# Suggested edit order:
# 1. sut_factory
# 2. command_mappings.*.method
# 3. verify_context.state_reader
# 4. verify_override
# 5. initial_state / next_state_override only when the inferred model state is not enough
# 6. applicable_override / guard_failure_policy when guard handling or invalid-path behavior matters
